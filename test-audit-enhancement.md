# Audit Enhancement Test Plan

## Issue Fixed
The audit system was not properly extracting user ID from JWT tokens because:
1. `@Async` methods were trying to access thread-local context (SecurityContextHolder, RequestContextHolder)
2. These contexts are not available in async threads
3. Both `userId` and `username` fields were being set to the same value

## Solution Implemented
1. **Synchronous Extraction**: Modified `AuditService.logSuccess()` and `logFailure()` to extract user data from the HTTP request directly before async processing
2. **Proper JWT Parsing**: Added `extractUserIdFromRequest()` and `extractUsernameFromRequest()` methods that parse JWT tokens directly from Authorization headers
3. **Fixed AuthenticationAuditInterceptor**: Enhanced to properly extract user ID from JWT tokens for authentication events

## Expected JWT Token Structure
```json
{
  "userId": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
  "authorities": ["ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN"],
  "sub": "gjpb",
  "jti": "b994232a-b725-4226-8b4f-790c590b4030",
  "iat": 1755303681,
  "exp": 1755346881
}
```

## Expected Audit Log Fields
- **userId**: `"f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"` (from JWT `userId` claim)
- **username**: `"gjpb"` (from JWT `sub` claim)

## Test Cases
1. **Authentication Endpoints**: Login/logout operations should capture user ID and username correctly
2. **API Endpoints**: All API calls with valid JWT should have proper user ID and username
3. **Anonymous Calls**: Calls without JWT should have null user ID and username

## Files Modified
1. `AuditService.java`: Added synchronous JWT extraction methods
2. `AuthenticationAuditInterceptor.java`: Enhanced user ID extraction
3. `dashboard-api.md`: Updated documentation with correct field examples
